Fast-Food-Menu-Health-Analysis
This project analyzes fast food menu nutrition data using Power BI. Data cleaning was performed using Power BI and Excel, followed by an interactive dashboard to evaluate calorie intake, fat contribution, sodium levels, protein content, and overall menu health across popular fast food restaurants.

🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze fast food nutrition data and identify healthier and unhealthier menu patterns based on calories, fat percentage, sodium, and protein. The dashboard supports data-driven and health-conscious food choices.

📸 Dashboard Preview
Dashboard screenshots are available in the Screenshots folder, showcasing:

Key KPIs (Average Calories, Fat %, Sodium, Protein)
Calories by restaurant
Fat contribution health categories
Sodium comparison
Calories vs Protein balance
Menu health distribution by restaurant

📊 Dashboard Overview
Key metrics analyzed in the dashboard:

Average Calories (Kcal)
Average Fat Calories Percentage
Average Sodium (mg)
Average Protein (g)

Health classification used:
Healthy: Fat calories < 30%
Moderate: Fat calories between 30% – 50%
Unhealthy: Fat calories > 50%

🧠 Key Insights
Most fast food items are high in calories and sodium, indicating health risks.
Several restaurants fall into the unhealthy fat calorie category.
Some restaurants provide a better protein-to-calorie balance, making them relatively healthier.
Overall, healthy menu options are limited across restaurants.
